# Using Evolutionary Algorithm to Optimize a Structure of Neural Network for a specific ML task
In this project, the genetic algorithm was used to optimize a structure of a Fully Connected Neural Network on a problem described in [link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/158/poker+hand) with its dataset.
Population of randomly generated individuals was evolved through generations and achived an increse in model accuracy using this algorithm.
Fully described version of this algotihm was described in PowerPoint presentation and in the paper which you can see in repository.
